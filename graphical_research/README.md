## Point Cloud Tutorial by Markus Heckmann (Derivative)

Project based on fantastic [Markus Heckmann point cloud tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB3P0-uCszo) , it creates a 3D mesh particle dissolve effect, all the particle system (position, life, color) is built with TOP, very cool features explained here. Project also contains a custom OBJ to Point Cloud converter/normalizer.
